# FlatRuby
A new graphic way to visualize runnable Ruby code.

# Context
Almost all non-graphic programming is written and interpreted statement by statement, in a linear fashion that Version Control loves so much. On the other extreme, graphic programming languages is good for education, but they often restrinct the user to a very narrow set of capabilities. **FlatRuby** attempts to be the middle ground: non-graphic programming visualized in a graphic two-dimensional aesthetic way.

# Is this for serious?
Beauty and aesthetic code is also a very serious bussiness.

# Todo
- Upload the model code.
- Release the first version.
- Create the specifications.
- Make this project a gem.
